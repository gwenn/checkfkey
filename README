There is a built-in [PRAGMA](http://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_foreign_key_check) since SQLite 3.7.16 (2013-03-18)...

OVERVIEW

This is a modified version of the 'genfkey' tool:
  - for each foreign key declaration, the program checks that there is at least one associated index,
  - triggers are not generated, instead queries are generated to check that there is no dangling FKs.
